Process: Spin Up a Development Environment for Ionic 4 (default Angular) Apps on a Linux (Mint 19) Platform

I found the documentation required to spin up a development environment for Ionic mobile apps... anemic at best.  

The docs were very weak sauce. The process to ferret out development cycle gotchas was extremely time consuming.  

I don't like wasting the time of my development teams.  And I don't think that _"learning to take your lumps as a developer"_ is constructive either.   

This guide should facilitate any developer with reasaonable level of Unix/Linux erperience to get up to speed on developing Ionic apps for Android devices without wasting enourmous amounts of valuable time.  

I will develop this spin-up process in the style of the venerable Peter Hintjens, whereby every action-item in the "pipeline" is 
entered and resolved as an issue, viz:

- survey: WTF is Ionic?

- explain: WTF use Ionic?

- understand: Background/History of Ionic

- watch (~14m): Introductory Ionic Video

- install: Node.js, npm, and ionic

- upgrade: Node.js (and npm) to their latest versions

- install: cordova

- exercise 1: A basic Ionic4 "hello world" starter PWA (no IDE required)

- understand: The Ionic CLI-driven "start... serve" cycle

- exercise 2: simple button event processing w/ deployment onto Ionic Lab View Server

- install: Android Studio (and various Java-related dependencies)

- install: Oracle JDK V8 (required for Android Studio builds)

- install: Gradle CI/CD pipeline tools (required for Ionic Android Studio builds)

- resolve: Ionic Android Build Errors

- exercise 3: Build & deploy simple button event processing app onto Android devic


There are a few other "farther horizon" issues (important, but not strictly required) recorded as well:


- install/configure: git & GitHub in coordination w/ Ionic workflows

- review: Apache Cordova (underlying framework for hybrid mobile apps)

- survey: Quick Testing using Ionic Framework CDN

- install: cordova (needs review/modification, b/c my install was rather janky)
